details: The remi Python package through 2022.7.27 doesn't sanitize or escape values
  such as text input conent, thus leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in
  case attacker-controlled values are processed in the application.

  Even if the application is used only by trusted users (e.g. behind a VPN), if
  it's used to process attacker-controlled data, arbitrary scripts can be executed
  in the application.
